## About myself

 I’m 23 years old. A year and a half ago I graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. Now I work as an engineer in a test center. My job doesn't suit me at all. So, I decided to find a sphere that would be of interest to me.I think front-end development will help me realize my mental and creative potential.
